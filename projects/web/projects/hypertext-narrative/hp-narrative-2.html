         	The increase in technology’s <a href="hp-narrative-3.html">abstraction</a> and interconnection points to a vague but compelling goal. To punch up against the universe. A desire to remove ourselves from the pain and struggle of death. To redefine the human condition on our terms. It’s an impulse to fight against all <a href="hp-narrative-10.html">natural boundaries</a>. In this way it can never truly be satisfied, but the process of technological development is <a href="hp-narrative-6.html">recursive</a> and self-informing, always building on itself, and reflects a comforting idea of constant progress.
