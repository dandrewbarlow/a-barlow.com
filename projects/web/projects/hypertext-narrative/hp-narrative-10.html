	       	Like the fateful <a href="hp-narrative-4.html">Tower of Babel</a>, the internet’s success also drives people apart. <a href="hp-narrative-8.html">Anonymity</a> allows for a wealth of unverifiable information, and brings out the worst side in people. I think in the future people will catch on, but the internet as a disinformation tool is the unfortunate reality we find ourselves in today. Until political meme pages are viewed the same way as <a href="hp-narrative-1.html">deposed Nigerian princes</a>, this will probably continue. I’m hopeful that day will come soon however.
