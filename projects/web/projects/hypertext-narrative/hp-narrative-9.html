	       As computer screens spread like <a href="hp-narrative-9.html">hotcakes</a>, imagining a tech-free life gets harder and harder. The future is uncertain, but technology still has a long time before finding its <a href="hp-narrative-1.html">upper bound</a>. Technology culture is the future, and I for one can’t wait until <a href="hp-narrative-6.html">virtual reality</a> lets you plug into the matrix. Trying to guess where else technology could go from here boggles my mind. How could anyone communicate more efficiently? We’re already plugged in.
