        	The internet has created a <a href="hp-narrative-9.html">network of information</a> that can inform anyone about nearly anything. The effects of this type of information system on our <a href="hp-narrative-7.html">society</a> can only be speculated at this point. Maybe modern computers will be viewed like a book or <a href="hp-narrative-1.html">cassette tape</a> to our grandchildrenâ€™s quantum computer AR contact lenses, but it is currently the high water mark for known information systems. Its abstraction and connection provide a superhighway on which ideas can flow like no other time in known history.
