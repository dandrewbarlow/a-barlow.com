	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
	My name is Andrew Barlow :) I am a former computer science major turned TAM. I play the banjo but don't like to advertise as a "yee haw" type. I like glitch art and the satisfaction of coding my own weird programs.
	</p>
	<p>
	I am interested in making websites for my own projects, and have experience from the web class and some begginer forays into web development before then.
	</p>
	<p>
	I want to learn how to make websites that utilize the more common and more advanced industry tools, like react, more advanced javascript, possibly php/mySQL (I know that's more backend, but still good stuff), as well as generally learning to make more interactive websites using advanced techniques.
